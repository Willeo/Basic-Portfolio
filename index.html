            lose their chlorophyll. It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. And I know
            you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. From all of us here, I want to wish
            you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world.
            <br>
            <br> In your world you can create anything you desire. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way.
            You can get away with a lot. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Even the worst thing we
            can do here is good. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.
            <br>
            <br> This is truly an almighty mountain. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. You can do anything here - the
            only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. There
            we go.</p>
