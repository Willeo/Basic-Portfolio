It's hard to see things when you're too close. Take a step back and look. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends. Paint anything you want on the canvas. Create your own world.</p>

    <p>In your world you can create anything you desire. With something so strong, a little bit can go a long way. You can get away with a lot. Trees get lonely too, so we'll give him a little friend. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Let's put some happy little bushes on the other side now.</p>

    <p>This is truly an almighty mountain. It looks so good, I might as well not stop. You can do anything here - the only pre-requisite is that it makes you happy. Just go back and put one little more happy tree in there. There we go.</p>
